                    <p><br>Maybe you’re managing anxiety, trauma, or burnout so heavy it follows you everywhere. You’ve got a full plate — work, family, expectations — and somewhere along the way, you got lost in the shuffle. Maybe you’re just trying to be better for your kids, or break toxic cycles that keep pulling you back.<br>You’re exhausted, overwhelmed, and done with surface-level fixes. You want real change — even if you’re not quite sure what that looks like yet.<p>

                    <p><br>Therapy with me is real talk, real tools, and no fluff.<br>This isn’t a place to vent and go — it’s where we do the work, at your pace, in your voice. I use a mix of <b>DBT, Brainspotting, trauma-informed care,</b> and practical strategies to help you manage the now and heal the past.<br>I’m trained in <b>complex trauma</b>, and I’ll challenge you (with compassion) to stop shrinking yourself to survive. My style is honest, flexible, and focused on helping you show up for yourself.<br>If you're ready to stop pretending and start processing, we’ll be a good fit.<p>

            <p>In our first session, we’ll lay the foundation. No pressure to dive deep unless you’re ready. You set the pace — I just help you find the path.<br>Each session is tailored to you, not a checkbox. We might focus on the day-to-day stressors, or we might unpack long-standing pain. Either way, the goal is clarity, healing, and strategies you can actually use.<br> Between sessions, I may offer reflections or tools that help you apply our work in the real world. But this isn’t homework for homework’s sake — it’s about building something real, sustainable, and <em>yours</em>.<p>
