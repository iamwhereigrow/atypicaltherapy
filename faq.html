            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p>Therapy can feel confusing — or like something you’re supposed to already know how to do. You don’t need to have it all figured out before reaching out. Here’s what new (and curious) clients often ask:</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Frequently asked questions during consultations</h2>
                    <h3><br>What can I expect in the first session?</h3>
                    <p>You can share as much or as little as you’re comfortable with — there’s no pressure to dive into anything you’re not ready for. I’ll guide the session with questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on now and what you’ve been through. You can always choose not to answer something — this is your space, your pace. The goal is to build a strong foundation and start mapping a direction together.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Do you take insurance or offer sliding scale?</h3>
                    <p>Yes — I’m in-network with several major insurance providers, and I offer a sliding scale for self-pay clients based on financial need.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Do you offer virtual therapy?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! I offer secure, HIPAA-compliant telehealth sessions for clients anywhere in Florida. All you need is a private space and a decent internet connection.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Do you work with couples or families?</h3>
                    <p>I work with couples who want to improve communication, connection, and shared emotional health. I don’t currently offer family therapy — but when working with teens, I may invite parents or siblings into a session if it supports the client’s growth or safety.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>What if I need to cancel or reschedule a session?</h3>
                    <p>Things come up — I get that. What matters most is communication. If you need to cancel, just let me know. I’ll do my best to reschedule within the same week to avoid any fees. What I can’t work with is <b>no-shows or chronic last-minute cancellations</b> — therapy only works when we both show up for it.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Can I text or email you between sessions?</h3>
                    <p>Yes — I encourage clients to reach out between sessions if they need to. You’re welcome to send long rant texts, voice memos, screenshots, TikToks, Reels — whatever helps you process. I’ll respond as soon as I’m able, and we can bring it into our next session if needed.<br>I <em>can’t</em> provide crisis support through messages, and I don’t guarantee instant availability, but I’m here to walk with you through the hard stuff. Sometimes I offer <b>coaching or processing support between sessions</b>if it fits your needs — just know we’ll always center the real work in session.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Do you assign homework or tools outside of sessions?</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes. It depends on what works for you and what we’re working on. Homework could look like journaling, trying out a coping strategy, tracking a pattern, or just reflecting on something we explored in session. You’ll never be forced into a one-size-fits-all approach — it’s about what supports your growth.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>What if I’ve had bad experiences with therapy in the past?</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, you’re not alone — and I hear this often. Maybe it felt too surface-level, too clinical, or like your therapist just didn’t get you. That’s not what this is. I show up fully. We’ll build real connection and do real work — no fluff, no check-the-box approach. And if something feels off? You get to say so. That’s part of the work too.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>What is Brainspotting therapy?</h3>
                    <p><b>Brainspotting</b> is a powerful brain-body therapy that helps you access and process unresolved trauma, stress, and emotional pain that might feel stuck — even if you can’t fully put it into words.<br>It uses specific eye positions to locate and unlock where your brain and body are holding emotional blocks. It’s especially helpful for clients dealing with trauma, dissociation, anxiety, or intense emotional responses that don’t respond well to talk therapy alone.<br>You don’t have to explain everything for Brainspotting to work — and we’ll always go at your pace.<br></p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Real-World Questions I Actually Get Asked</h2>
                    <h3><br>Can I swear in session?<br></h3>
                    <p>Please do. Show me what’s happening in your world — texts, notes, memes, voice memos, social media — whatever gives us insight. We’ll use it to make sense of patterns and build strategies that actually work in your life.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>What if I don’t want to talk about my past right away?</h3>
                    <p>That’s okay. You don’t have to go there until you're ready — if ever. Some days we focus on putting out fires, other days we go deep. You set the pace.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Do I have to be “broken” to go to therapy?</h3>
                    <p>Hell no. You just have to be human. Whether you're falling apart or holding it together by a thread, you’re welcome here — no labels, no judgment.<br></p>
                    <h3><br>Still have a question?</h3>
                    <p>No problem — reach out directly via <b><a href="contact.html">email or text</a></b>  and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.<br></p>
