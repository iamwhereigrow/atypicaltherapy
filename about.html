                    <p>I didn’t become a therapist because of one moment — I became one because this has always been the work. I knew early on that people need people. We need spaces where we feel seen, heard, and safe to be messy. Growing up, I didn’t always have that. And when I finally did seek support, I ran into therapists who didn’t listen, didn’t build rapport, and didn’t seem to know me at all.<br><br>I wanted something different — so I created it.<br><br>My practice is grounded in connection, collaboration, and authenticity. I’m not here to nod and ask, “How does that make you feel?” I’m here to sit in it with you, help you unpack it, call it out when it’s holding you back, and help you build something better. We’ll talk, problem-solve, laugh, swear (if that’s your style), and work together toward what’s next.</p>

                    <h4>How I Work</h4>
                      <p><br>Therapy with me is interactive and flexible — every session is different, because every person is. Some days we’ll dig into trauma. Some days, we’ll just try to get through the damn day. You set the pace, I provide the tools and support. I use a mix of <b>DBT</b>,  <b>Brainspotting</b>, and <b>trauma-informed strategies</b>, always grounded in <b>real-world application</b>.
