            <p><b>Therapy that meets you where you are — and helps you move forward.</b></p>
            <p>No two clients are the same, so no two sessions should be either. Whether you're navigating daily stress, processing trauma, or just trying to make it through the week, we’ll work together in a way that fits you. My goal is to help you feel seen, supported, and empowered — with practical tools, real talk, and space to grow.<br><br></p>
            <p>I offer <b>in-person therapy in Rockledge, Florida</b>, and <b>virtual therapy across the state of Florida</b>.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Individual Therapy</h2>
                    <p><br>I work with adults facing anxiety, depression, relationship issues, trauma, self-doubt, burnout, or just feeling stuck.Together, we’ll explore what’s going on beneath the surface and build strategies that actually help in real life — not just in session.</p>               
                </div>
                <div class="box box2">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Anxiety & Depression</h2>
                    <p><br>These two often go hand-in-hand — and they can be overwhelming, isolating, and exhausting. In therapy, we’ll untangle the root causes, build coping skills, and explore healthier thought patterns so you can feel more grounded and in control.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box box3">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Trauma & Complex PTSD</h2>
                    <p><br>Trauma doesn’t have to be big or loud to leave a lasting impact. Whether you’ve experienced childhood wounds, abuse, systemic trauma, or repeated emotional invalidation, I offer a space to process and heal using real-world strategies.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Brainspotting</h2>
                    <p><br><br><br>I use <b>Brainspotting</b>, a powerful brain-body therapy that helps clients move through trauma that talk therapy sometimes can’t touch. It works by accessing the part of your brain where trauma and stress are stored, even if you can’t fully explain what happened. Brainspotting is especially helpful for PTSD, anxiety, dissociation, and intense emotional responses — and we’ll always go at your pace.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Substance Use Support</h2>
                    <p><br>Whether you're in recovery, questioning your relationship with substances, or trying to make a change, I offer judgment-free support that honors your autonomy while helping you explore what’s driving your patterns.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box box1">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">LGBTQIA+ Affirming Therapy</h2>
                    <p><br>You deserve a therapist who sees all of you. I provide a space where you don’t have to explain your identity, defend your experiences, or shrink yourself. This is an inclusive, affirming environment for processing whatever you're going through — from gender and sexuality to family dynamics, self-worth, and beyond.</p>

                    <p><br>If you spend your life helping others, therapy can feel unfamiliar — even uncomfortable. I offer a space where you can be vulnerable, honest, and real. You don’t have to hold it all together here. Whether you're a clinician, paramedic, dispatcher, nurse, or front-line worker — this is for you, too.</p>

                <div class="box box1">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Neurodivergent Clients & Autism Support</h2>
                    <p><br>I work with clients who identify as neurodivergent — including those with or exploring autism — to better understand themselves and the systems around them. We’ll focus on creating sustainable strategies, healthy boundaries, and a space to be your full, unmasked self.</p>

                <div class="box box2">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">OCD Therapy</h2>
                    <p><br>As a trained OCD specialist, I provide evidence-based therapy that addresses both obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. We’ll work to reduce distress, challenge intrusive patterns, and regain a sense of agency without shame or avoidance.</p>

                    <p><br>Adolescence is hard. Whether your teen is struggling with anxiety, self-esteem, identity, school stress, or behavior changes, therapy gives them a space to process what’s going on without fear of judgment. I meet teens where they are — with honesty, patience, and respect.</p>
