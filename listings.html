            <h1>Where You Can Find Me Online</h1>
            <p><br>
              The internetâ€™s great, but it can also be messy. If youâ€™ve ever searched for my name and ended up confused by the different therapist profiles out thereâ€”you're not alone. There are a lot of sites that auto-generate provider listings or pull from outdated data, and itâ€™s not always clear which ones are accurate or actively maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
              To clear things up:
              <li>
                These are my only active and legitimate online profiles.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you see my name elsewhere and itâ€™s not listed here, thatâ€™s not me.
              </li>
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is a breakdown of where Iâ€™m officially listed, what each platform is for, and how you can use them to connect with me.
